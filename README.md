This is a simple script that uses **PRAW**, a very handy **Reddit** API wrapper in order to extract data from the latest **/r/worldnews** submissions.

Although, this method is not appropriate for gathering a lot of data as Reddit will limit the volume of data accessible (this is not a matter of number of request per second).
